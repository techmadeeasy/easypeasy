## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techmadeeasy/easypeasy.git
   cd easypeasy
   ```

2. **Build and start containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. **Verify**

   Visit the app at: `http://localhost:9000`

_No manual migrations or seeders needed_ â€” everything is set up on container startup.

---

## Usage

### Starting the Containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Running the Worker

Keep the worker running to process queued jobs:

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan background:work --sleep=3
```

### Dispatching Jobs

Use the `job-worker.php` script to fire off jobs manually (for testing):

```bash
# Basic: class, method, payload
docker-compose exec app php job-worker.php TestJob handle "param1,param2"

# With delay (seconds) and priority (lower = higher priority)
docker-compose exec app php job-worker.php TestJob handle "param1,param2" 30 5
```

The global helper `runBackgroundJob($class, $method, $params, $delay, $priority)` will queue the job in the database.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `config/background-jobs.php` and can be overridden via environment variables:

| Setting                   | Env Variable                        | Default             | Description                                |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `table`                   | `BG_JOBS_TABLE`                     | `background_jobs`   | DB table name for jobs                    |
| `retry_attempts`          | `BG_JOBS_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`            | `3`                 | Max retry attempts on failure             |
| `retry_delay`             | `BG_JOBS_RETRY_DELAY`               | `60`                | Seconds between retries                   |
| `default_priority`        | `BG_JOBS_DEFAULT_PRIORITY`          | `5`                 | Default priority for new jobs (lower = higher) |

You can also whitelist your job classes and methods in the same config.

---

## Dashboard

A simple web UI is available at `/background-jobs` to view:

- ðŸ“‹ Job ID, class, method
- ðŸŽ¯ Priority & next run time
- ðŸŸ¢ Status (Pending / Error / Completed)
- ðŸ”„ Attempt counts

Feel free to extend it with filtering, cancelling, or auto-refresh.

---

## Testing

A sample test case is provided in `tests/Feature/JobWorkerTestCase.php`. Run your test suite with:

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan test
```

---

## Contributing

We welcome improvements! Some ideas:

- Use named CLI flags (`--delay=30`)
- Enhance error handling and logging
- Add more unit and integration tests
- Build advanced scheduling (cron, recurring jobs)
- Strengthen dashboard (search, filtering, cancel/resume)
- Harden security on job endpoints
